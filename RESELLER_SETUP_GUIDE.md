# Bright Minds Academy - Reseller Setup Guide

## Welcome! 🎉

You've purchased the Bright Minds Academy educational platform template. This guide will walk you through setting up your own branded version.

## Step 1: Remix the Project

1. **Click the "Remix" button** in the top right of the Lovable editor
2. This creates your own copy of the entire project
3. You now have full editing control

## Step 2: Enable Lovable Cloud (CRITICAL for AI Features)

**Why?** The AI story generator and game creator require an API key. You need your own key so AI usage is billed to YOUR account, not the original creator's.

### How to Enable:

1. In your remixed project, look for the **Cloud** button in the top navigation
2. Click **"Enable Lovable Cloud"**
3. Follow the prompts to activate (free tier available)
4. This automatically generates your `LOVABLE_API_KEY`

**That's it!** The AI features will now work using YOUR credentials.

### What Happens if You Skip This?

- AI story generator won't work
- AI game creator won't work
- AI tutor chat won't work
- You'll see "LOVABLE_API_KEY not configured" errors

## Step 3: Customize Your Branding

1. **Login** to your platform (you'll need to create an account first)
2. Navigate to **Dashboard** → **White Label Settings**
3. Customize:
   - Platform name
   - Logo
   - Colors (primary & secondary)
   - Tagline
   - Contact email
   - Social links
   - Custom domain (optional)

## Step 4: Publish Your Platform

1. Click the **"Publish"** button in the top right
2. Your platform will be live at: `yourname.lovable.app`
3. **Optional:** Connect your custom domain in Project Settings

## Step 5: Test AI Features

Before going live, test the AI features:

1. **Story Generator**: Create a test story to verify it works
2. **Game Creator**: Generate a sample game
3. **AI Tutor**: Have a test conversation

If any AI features fail, double-check that Lovable Cloud is enabled (Step 2).
