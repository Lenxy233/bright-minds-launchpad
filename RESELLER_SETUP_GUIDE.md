## 🚀 Quick Start (5-Minute Setup)

**Total Time: ~5 minutes**

### ✅ Step 1: Remix the Project (1 min)
1. Open the project link you received
2. Click the **"Remix"** button in the top right corner
3. Your own copy is now created ✨

### ✅ Step 2: Enable Lovable Cloud (2 min) - ⚠️ REQUIRED FOR AI FEATURES

**Why this matters:** The AI story generator, game creator, and tutor chat won't work without this step.

**What it does:** Generates YOUR own API key so AI usage is billed to YOUR account (not the seller's).

**How to enable:**
1. In your remixed project, click the **"Cloud"** button in the top navigation
2. Click **"Enable Lovable Cloud"**
3. Follow the simple prompts (free tier available - no credit card required to start)
4. Done! Your `LOVABLE_API_KEY` is automatically configured

**⚠️ What happens if you skip this:**
- ❌ AI story generator won't work
- ❌ AI game creator won't work  
- ❌ AI tutor chat won't work
- ❌ You'll see "API key not configured" errors

### ✅ Step 3: Connect Your Own Database (3 min) - ⚠️ CRITICAL STEP

**Why this matters:** Without your own database, the platform won't work properly. All user data, stories, and progress tracking require a database connection.

**What you need to do:** Create a FREE Supabase account and connect it to your remixed project.

**Step-by-step instructions:**

1. **Create a Supabase Account** (30 seconds)
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Click "Start your project"
   - Sign up with GitHub, Google, or email (it's free!)

2. **Create a New Project** (1 minute)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Name it (e.g., "Bright Minds Academy")
   - Set a database password (save this somewhere safe!)
   - Choose a region close to your target users
   - Click "Create new project"
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for setup to complete

3. **Get Your Database Credentials** (30 seconds)
   - In your Supabase project dashboard, click "Settings" (gear icon)
   - Click "API" in the left sidebar
   - You'll need two values:
     - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
     - **Anon/Public Key** (long string starting with `eyJ...`)
   - Keep this tab open - you'll need these in the next step

4. **Connect Supabase to Your Lovable Project** (1 minute)
   - Go back to your remixed Lovable project
   - In the Lovable editor, type in the AI chat:
     ```
     Connect my Supabase project. 
     Project URL: [paste your URL]
     Anon Key: [paste your key]
     ```
   - The AI will automatically configure everything for you!

**⚠️ What happens if you skip this:**
- ❌ User registration won't work
- ❌ Story saving/loading won't work
- ❌ Progress tracking won't work
- ❌ Parent dashboard won't work
- ❌ Most features will be broken

**💰 Cost:** Supabase is FREE for up to 500MB database + 2GB bandwidth per month (plenty for getting started!)

### ✅ Step 4: Publish Your Platform (1 min)
1. Click the **"Publish"** button in the top right
2. Your platform goes live at: `yourname.lovable.app`
3. That's it! Your platform is now online 🎉

### ✅ Step 5: Access Additional Resources (1 min)
1. Check your purchase email for the **Google Drive link**
2. Download any editable templates or bonus files you need
3. These are yours to use and customize however you like

### ✅ Step 6: Test Everything (1 min)
1. Visit your live site
2. Try the AI Story Generator
3. Try the AI Game Creator
4. Browse the educational content library

**If AI features don't work:** Go back to Step 2 and verify Lovable Cloud is enabled.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### ❌ "LOVABLE_API_KEY not configured" Error
**Problem:** AI features show this error message  
**Solution:** You skipped Step 2. Go back and enable Lovable Cloud in your remixed project.

### ❌ AI Features Still Not Working After Enabling Cloud
**Problem:** Story generator or game creator fails  
**Solution:**  
1. Go to Settings → Secrets in your Lovable project
2. Verify `LOVABLE_API_KEY` exists
3. If missing, disable and re-enable Lovable Cloud
4. Publish your project again

### ❌ Branding Changes Not Saving
**Problem:** Logo/colors don't update  
**Solution:**  
1. Make sure you're logged into your published platform (not the Lovable editor)
2. Create a user account first if you haven't already
3. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### ❌ Can't Connect Custom Domain
**Problem:** Custom domain setup fails  
**Solution:**  
1. Verify you have a paid Lovable plan (custom domains require paid plan)
2. Follow the guide: [docs.lovable.dev/features/custom-domains](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/custom-domains)
3. DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate

### ❌ "Access Denied" When Trying to Edit
**Problem:** Can't make changes to the project  
**Solution:** Make sure you clicked "Remix" first. You can't edit the original - you need your own copy.
