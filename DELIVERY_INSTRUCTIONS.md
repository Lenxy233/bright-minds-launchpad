## Setting Up Google Drive Sharing (Before First Sale)

### Step 1: Organize Your Files
1. Create a new Google Drive folder: "Bright Minds Academy - Buyer Resources"
2. Upload all additional documents:
   - Editable Word/PowerPoint templates
   - PDF source files
   - Any formats not in the web platform
   - Bonus content or resources
3. Organize into subfolders by category (optional but recommended)

### Step 2: Configure Sharing Settings
1. Right-click the main folder → Share
2. Under "General access" → Click "Restricted"
3. Change to **"Anyone with the link"**
4. Set permission to **"Viewer"** (prevents editing)
5. Click "Copy link"
6. Save this link - you'll use it in every delivery email

### Step 3: Test Access
1. Open the link in an incognito/private browser window
2. Verify you can view and download files without logging in
3. Make sure no sensitive/personal files are included

### Step 4: Update Delivery Email
1. Paste the Google Drive link in the email template above (line 27)
2. Replace `[INSERT YOUR GOOGLE DRIVE SHARE LINK HERE]` with your actual link

## Checklist for You Before Delivery

- [ ] Make sure your Lovable project is set to "Public" or "Unlisted" so they can remix it
- [ ] Test the remix process yourself to ensure it works
- [ ] **Set up Google Drive folder with "Anyone with the link" (Viewer) access**
- [ ] **Test Google Drive link in incognito mode to verify access**
- [ ] Update any placeholder text with your actual links/info (Lovable URL + Drive link)
- [ ] Consider recording a quick video walkthrough (optional but helpful)
- [ ] Prepare to answer questions about Lovable (most buyers won't know it)
